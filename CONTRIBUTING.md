# How to Contribute

First, if you want to contribute you should probably join the Discord server at http://discord.gg/s76zUPR . Feel free to invite your friends too, if you hear that anyone is interested.

## Formatting

All .java files should be formatted using Google Style before pushing. Downloads for Google style can be found [here](https://github.com/google/styleguide). Since the Google Style xmls are distributed with a CC-BY license, I have included a copy in this repository. Please use it for this project if you plan on pushing any changes to keep code consistent.

## Issues 
Next, take a look at the Issues section, as well as the Projects page to see what things need doing. Most of the work currently involves GUI improvements, but there is some backend work too if you prefer that sort of thing.

## Wiki
In order to help people understand how Prima play works, ~~I am currently in the process of writing a full wiki on the library, including detailed descriptions of how every class works, and how it all fits together.~~ I am no longer working on the wiki, however any help with this is much appreciated if you feel like helping to work on it. I would also love to be notified of grammar / spelling mistakes if you find any, or you can fix them yourself if you want to.

## Contributing
If you are a confident Java developer and you feel like you understand how the project functions, let me know and I will consider adding you to the repository to allow you to push changes directly.

Lastly, if there is anything I can do to help you to contribute in any way, just ask. I'm not one to shy away from criticism or questions, I want this project to do well and I will do anything to help anyone who wants the same.

Thanks :)
